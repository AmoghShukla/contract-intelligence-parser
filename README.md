# 📑 Contract Intelligence Parser

### Project Overview

This project provides a **technical solution for an accounts receivable SaaS platform** by automating the process of parsing contracts to extract critical financial and operational data.

The system is designed to provide a **scalable and reliable solution** for business users, addressing the challenges of manual contract review by reducing human error and time-consuming tasks.

The application is built using a **modern, containerized architecture** to ensure portability, scalability, and ease of deployment.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

* **Backend**: Python (Flask) REST API handles file uploads, manages asynchronous processing, and interacts with the database.
* **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL) stores contract metadata and extracted data.
* **Frontend**: Single-page web app (HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript) with a user-friendly interface.
* **Deployment**: Entire stack containerized with **Docker** and orchestrated via **docker-compose**.

---

## ✨ Features

* 📤 **Contract Upload**: Non-blocking POST endpoint accepts PDF files and returns an immediate `contract_id`.
* ⚙️ **Asynchronous Processing**: Background thread parses contracts without blocking API responses.
* 📊 **Status Tracking**: Real-time progress tracking via dedicated GET endpoint.
* 📑 **Data Extraction**: Returns structured JSON data with a confidence score.
* 💾 **Persistent Storage**: Metadata and extracted data stored in MongoDB.
* 🖥️ **Intuitive UI**: Clean drag-and-drop interface for easy use.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Docker Desktop** (Ensure it is installed and running)

### Setup & Run

```bash
# Clone the repository (or navigate to your project directory)
cd your-project-directory  

# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build
```

⏳ The first run may take a few minutes as images are downloaded. Logs will confirm that **MongoDB** and **Flask** services are running.

### Access the Frontend

Open the `index.html` file in your browser to access the web application.

## 🔗 API Endpoints

| Method   | Endpoint                          | Description                                                                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **POST** | `/contracts/upload`               | Accepts a PDF file, starts background processing, returns `contract_id`.            |
| **GET**  | `/contracts/{contract_id}/status` | Checks processing status (`pending`, `processing`, `completed`). Includes progress. |
| **GET**  | `/contracts/{contract_id}`        | Retrieves final extracted JSON data + confidence score.                             |
| **GET**  | `/contracts`                      | (🚧 Not Implemented) Lists all contracts.                                           |

## 🛠️ System Design & Code Quality

* **Scalability**: Non-blocking background thread (production-ready upgrade → Celery/message queue).
* **Reliability**: Simulated progress + error handling; all data persisted in MongoDB.
* **Maintainability**: Modular codebase with clear separation of concerns.
* **Deployment**: Fully containerized with Docker for consistent environments.
